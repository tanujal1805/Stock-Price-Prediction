# Stock-Price-Prediction
This project uses time series analysis and an LSTM neural network to predict stock prices. By handling sequential stock data, the model captures time-dependent patterns to achieve 80% prediction accuracy.

Key Features:
- Time series data handling and preprocessing.
- LSTM model for accurate stock price forecasting.
- Achieved 80% accuracy on predictions.
- Visualized results using Python libraries.
Technologies:
- Python, TensorFlow/Keras, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
